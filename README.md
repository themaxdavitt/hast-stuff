# hast stuff

This is an old attempt to use custom [Node.js module loaders](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/esm.html#loaders) to build an asset pipeline for the [`unified` ecosystem](https://unifiedjs.com). There's also some other weird stuff in here, like [oEmbed](https://oembed.com) data processing. It's incomplete, messy, and probably buggy. I don't remember what version of Node I used it with, and I'm sure the dependencies are very out-of-date now. I've been sitting on all this since June 2021, and for the most part I haven't touched it since then. I probably should've shared it sooner. I hope someone finds this insightful or at least useful.
